# Ethereum: The World's Programmable Blockchain

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality. While Bitcoin is often viewed as "digital gold," Ethereum is the "digital oil" that powers a global, decentralized computing platform.

## Core Infrastructure

Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** during "The Merge." This shift reduced the network's energy consumption by over **99.9%**.

### Key Components

* **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** The runtime environment for smart contracts. It acts as a global computer where every node executes the same instructions to maintain consensus.
* **Nodes & Validators:** Participants who stake **32 ETH** to propose and verify blocks. In 2026, the network is increasingly moving toward "statelessness," allowing nodes to verify the chain without storing the entire history.
* **Ether (ETH):** The native cryptocurrency used to pay for "Gas" (transaction fees) and to secure the network through staking.

## The 2026 Roadmap: Scaling & Efficiency

As of 2026, Ethereum has moved past the "Merge" and "Shapella" eras, focusing on the **"Glamsterdam"** and **"Hegota"** upgrades.

### 1. Glamsterdam Upgrade (Early 2026)

This upgrade introduced **Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS)**. By splitting the role of those who bundle transactions and those who propose blocks, Ethereum has significantly reduced the centralization risks associated with MEV (Maximal Extractable Value).

### 2. The Surge & zk-Rollups

The roadmap in 2026 is "Rollup-Centric." Most retail users interact with Ethereum via **Layer 2 (L2)** solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and various zk-Rollups.

* **Data Blobs:** Building on EIP-4844, the network now supports larger "blob" capacities, lowering L2 transaction costs to fractions of a cent.
* **Lean Execution:** 2026 marks the first year where validators can process **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) execution proofs** instead of re-executing every transaction, paving the way for 10,000+ TPS.

## Technical Comparison: Layer 1 vs. Layer 2

| Feature | Ethereum Mainnet (L1) | Rollups (L2) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Settlement & Security | Execution & Scalability |
| **Speed** | ~15–30 TPS | 2,000+ TPS |
| **Cost** | High (Varies by demand) | Ultra-Low (via Blobs) |
| **Security** | Native Ethereum PoS | Inherited from L1 |

## Ecosystem Use Cases

* **DeFi (Decentralized Finance):** Sophisticated lending, borrowing, and trading protocols that operate without intermediaries.
* **RWA Tokenization:** In 2026, real-world assets like Treasury bills and real estate are increasingly being tokenized on-chain for instant settlement.
* **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations):** Entities governed by smart contracts rather than hierarchical management.
* **Digital Identity:** Using ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and Soulbound tokens to manage identity without centralized providers.

> **Pro-Tip for Developers:** To interact with the Ethereum network programmatically in 2026, the standard remains using libraries like **ethers.js** or **viem**, typically connecting to nodes via providers like Infura or Alchemy.
